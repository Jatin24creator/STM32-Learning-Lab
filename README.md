# STM32 Learning Lab

A hands-on learning repository documenting my journey with STM32 microcontrollers across multiple boards.

This repo contains small, focused experiments ranging from basic GPIO to peripherals and system-level concepts. Each experiment is structured for clarity, reproducibility, and incremental learning.

## Structure

- `boards/` – Board-specific experiments
- Each board contains day-wise projects
- Every project may include:
  - `fw-stm32cubeide/` – Full STM32CubeIDE project
  - `sim-wokwi/` – Simulation files (where applicable)
  - `README.md` – Project explanation
  - `notes.md` – Learning notes

## Tools Used
- STM32CubeIDE
- STM32 HAL
- Wokwi Simulator

## Boards
- STM32C031C6 (current)
- More STM32 series planned
