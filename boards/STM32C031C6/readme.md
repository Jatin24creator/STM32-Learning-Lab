# Day 02 – GPIO Pin State Control (STM32C031C6)

## Objective
Understand and implement GPIO pin state control using STM32 HAL by explicitly setting pin states and toggling them with time delays.

## What This Project Does
- Sets GPIO pin HIGH and LOW using `HAL_GPIO_WritePin()`
- Uses `GPIO_PinState` to control output state
- Introduces visible timing behavior using `HAL_Delay()`
- Experiments with different delay values to observe LED behavior

## Tools Used
- STM32CubeIDE
- STM32 HAL
- Wokwi Simulator (for simulation)
